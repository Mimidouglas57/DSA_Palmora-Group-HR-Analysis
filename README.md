## 📌 Project Overview

The Palmoria Group HR Analytics Project focuses on analyzing employee compensation, gender equity, and performance-based bonuses to support informed decision-making and ensure regulatory compliance.


## 🎯 Objectives

- Automate annual bonus allocation based on performance
- Evaluate salary fairness across gender, departments, and regions

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Initial data exploration focused on cleaning and preparing the employee and bonus datasets for analysis. Key steps included:

- Assigned `"Undisclosed"` to employees who didn’t reveal their gender  
- Removed employees with missing salaries (no longer with the company)  
- Filtered out records with `"NULL"` department entries  
- Replaced blank bonus fields with `0`  
- Verified data types and checked for outliers  
- Ensured performance ratings aligned with bonus rules

These steps ensured a clean, reliable dataset for analyzing salary structures, pay gaps, and bonus allocations.
